            <p>
                <br>Rohit Sharma is undoubtedly the cleanest hitter of a cricket ball you will ever see. Nothing can be as pleasing as the sight of the ‘Hitman’ striking the ball over the covers. Rohit Sharma is the current vice-captain of the Indian Cricket Team in the limited-overs.
               <br>
               <br> 
                <br>
                
                <br>Once hailed as a ‘talented’ youngster to later ridiculed by the critics for his inconsistency and now becoming an important cog in the Indian batting line up, this Mumbaikar’s journey is nothing short of a movie right there in the making.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                
                
                <br>Rohit is also the captain of the IPL team Mumbai Indians. Sharma currently holds the record for the highest individual score in One Day Internationals. He scored a record 264 off 173 balls against Srilanka on November 13, 2014. Rohit is also the only player to score two double centuries in One Day Internationals. He is also the only person to score 250+ in ODI innings.

<h3>Rohit Sharma Journey To Cricket</h3>

<div class="journey">
    
    
    <div class="cont">
        <ol>
            <li>In the initial days of his career, Rohit was coach by Dinesh Lad at the Swami Vivekanand International School, Mumbai. He taught Rohit without any coaching fee.</li>
            <li>It’s quite surprising that before becoming an opener batsman, Rohit was an off-spinner bowler.</li>
            <li>But coach Dinesh Lad noticed his batting ability and promoted him to open the innings. Rohit performed well in the Harris and Giles Shield school cricket tournaments and scored a century on debut as an opener.</li>
            <li>After a long time, he had bowled 2 overs of off Spin in the 1st test against England in 2021.
            </li>

    <li>Sharma made his India A debut against New Zealand A in a first-class match at Darwin in July 2006.</li>

<h3>T20 International Career</h3>

    <div class="cont">
        <ol>
            <li>When it comes to T20, you can hardly find a complete opener than Rohit Sharma.</li>
            <li>Rohit made his T20 debut for India against England in 2007 ICC World T20 Championships but did not get an opportunity to bat.</li>
<li>However, he did get an opportunity against South Africa in his second match and took it with both hands</li>
<li>In the semi-finals against Australia, Sharma made a small cameo at the end of the innings and scored 8* off 5 balls as India won by 15 runs.
</li>
<li>India won the final by 5 runs. In 2007, Sharma was used predominately as a middle-order batsman coming at number 7 or 8.
However, under MS Dhoni’s captainship, he has promoted up the order to open the innings. This change affected not only his T20 career but the ODI career as well.</li>
